# handu
Prototype for a narrative-led multi-user experience in mixed reality, using ðŸ‘‹ hand tracking and movement for world building. Built in Unity.

Handu is a many-fingered being born out of the digital, primordial sea, who creates the world out of their curiosity.

This was a student project created on the Virtual and Extended Realities MA at UWE, Bristol. Brief was set by industry client Ultraleap who supplied hand tracking technology and supported us.
